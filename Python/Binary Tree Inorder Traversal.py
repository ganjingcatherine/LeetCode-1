"""
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means?

OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
Here's an example:
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
